# Python Practice Questions

This repository contains a collection of Python practice problems aimed at reinforcing core programming concepts. These exercises cover a range of topics including loops, conditionals, functions, data structures, and more.

## Table of Contents

1. **Sum of Even Numbers (1 to 100)**  
   A program to compute the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

2. **Prime Number Checker**  
   A program that determines whether a given number is prime using loops and conditionals.

3. **Even Numbers Filter**  
   A function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

4. **Student Grades Dictionary**  
   A program that creates a dictionary of student grades in different subjects and calculates the average grade.

5. **String Reversal**  
   A program to reverse a given string without using built-in reverse functions.

6. **Factorial Finder**  
   A function that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop.

7. **Vowel Counter**  
   A Python program that counts the number of vowels in a string.

8. **Find Shortest and Longest Names**  
   A program to find the shortest and longest names from a list of names.

9. **Palindrome Checker**  
   A program that checks if a given word is a palindrome.

10. **Fibonacci Number Generator**  
    A program that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.

11. **List Intersection**  
    A program that finds the common elements between two lists.

12. **Word Replacer**  
    A script that replaces all occurrences of a specific word in a text with another word.

13. **String Sorting**  
    A program that sorts a list of strings in alphabetical order.

14. **Unique Values from List**  
    A function that accepts a list of integers and returns a new list with only unique values.

## How to Run

To run any of these Python programs, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-practice-questions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file you wish to run:
   ```
   cd python-practice-questions
   ```

3. Execute the Python file using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python <filename>.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the scripts.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the use of loops and conditionals in Python.
- Gain familiarity with working with lists, dictionaries, and strings.
- Practice implementing algorithms like factorial, prime number check, and palindrome detection.
- Strengthen your knowledge of Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and libraries.
